# Quadroot UAV
We have designed a self-flying quadrotor UAV, which is assembled from model airplane parts purchased online, and modified on the basis of complete assembly, including laser orbit determination, ultrasonic height determination, fixed point Take photos, sound sensor prompts, automatic landing, etc., rewrite the flight control program and increase the single-chip program regulation to complete the competition test requirements.
The four-rotor UAV takes the flight control as the core, and through the programming output signal, the self-flying control is unlocked and the motors are controlled to complete the flight task. The assembly and modification process took half a month, and finally the drone can fly autonomously according to the route we set.
The design features of the UAV: 
1. The body is light and powerful, and it can complete simple autonomous flight excellently.
2. The aircraft has simple materials, low cost and complete functions.
3. The aircraft can automatically land and land smoothly.
